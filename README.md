# LLMDataHub: Awesome Datasets for LLM Training
## Introduction
Large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT series, Google's Bard, and Baidu's Wenxin Yiyan, are driving profound technological changes. Recently, with the emergence of open-source large model frameworks like LlaMa and ChatGLM, training an LLM is no longer the exclusive domain of resource-rich companies. Training LLMs by small organizations or individuals has become an important interest in the open-source community, with some notable works including Alpaca, Vicuna, and Luotuo. In addition to large model frameworks, large-scale and high-quality training corpora are also essential for training large language models. Currently, relevant open-source corpora in the community are still scattered. Therefore, the goal of this repository is to continuously collect high-quality training corpora for LLMs in the open-source community.



Training a chatbot LLM that can follow human instruction effectively requires access to high-quality datasets that cover a range of conversation domains and styles. In this repository, we provide a curated collection of datasets specifically designed for chatbot training, including links, size, language, usage, and a brief description of each dataset. Our goal is to make it easier for researchers and practitioners to identify and select the most relevant and useful datasets for their chatbot LLM training needs. Whether you're working on improving chatbot dialogue quality, response generation, or language understanding, this repository has something for you.
